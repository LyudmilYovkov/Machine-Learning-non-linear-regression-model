This project shows the usage of a simple non-linear regression model with more than one predictor. The dataset contains real-world data (source for downloading: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/auto-mpg-dataset) about cars and has the following column structure: ["Acceleration", "Displacement", "Horsepower", "MPG", "Weight"] with approximately 400 rows. As predictor variables are being chosen "Horsepower" and "Weight" while as a response variable is being chosen "MPG". Some different non-linear models can be built when including other table variables into the regression equation and intorducing specific non-linear variable combinations (here we are using x1*x2 non-linearity). A convenient way to select among a few possible predictors is to calculate the respective correlation coefficients. The goodness of every fit may be evaluated by calculating R-squared and RMSE on both training and test sets.
